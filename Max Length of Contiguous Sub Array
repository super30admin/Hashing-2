Approach : since we might get similar counts of 0's and 1's for few subarrays. So we declare hashmap to record the value of count at each iteration.
During each iteration, we also check whether the cumulative count value at the current iteration occurs in previous iterations. 
If it did occur, we calculate the difference between their indices. That would be length of subarray where equal number of zeros and one's. Max of such scenarios
yields to the max length of the subarray. 

Time Complexity :O(n)
Space complexity : O(1)


class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count=0
        hashmap={0:-1}
        max_length=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count+= (1 if nums[i]==1 else -1)
            if count not in hashmap:
                hashmap[count]=i
            else:
                max_length=max(max_length,i-hashmap[count])
        return max_length
