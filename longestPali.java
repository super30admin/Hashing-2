// Longest Palindrome

// Time-Complexity- O(n) 
// Space Complexity-O(n) - creating a hashset to keep track of the characters
// passed test cases on leetcode-yes
// faced problem-no

In a palindrome there can be a case where the mid character present can occur only once, so we can choose anyone of the characters that left unpaired, so incrementing the count by 1 and returning ex:nitin have only 1 t and it is a palindrome, madam have one d and so it is. aaaa is still palindrome.
