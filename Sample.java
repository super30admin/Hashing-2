//Longest Palindrome

// Time Complexity : O(n) 
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//USed HashSet approach iterated String by using for loop and check that character is present or not
// If its not present add to hash set
// It its present increment the count to 2 and remove that character from HashSet
//At the end if the set is not empty i.e stil single characters are there then increment count to 1
