Find all sub arrays such that sum = K

Brute force : do iterations from every index using nested iterations
for every index, maintain all sub arrays - TC = O(n*n)

We use the same concept of running sum 
IF we have the running sum till index a and index c, running sum of sub array from a to (c-1) = rs_a-rs_c
We need the running sum of the sub array to be equal to k
rs_a-rs_c= k
 i.e. rs_c = rs_a - k 

we check if this has occured before - if yes, we check the number of times it happened

we store { sub_array sum : count } in the dict
