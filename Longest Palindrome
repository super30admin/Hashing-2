Idea: For a palindrome, there are the following two Approach: 
All letters in the string occur an even number of times; 
One letter occurs an odd number of times and the rest of the letters occur an even number of times
We can place the odd letter somewhere in the middle to make the string still a palandrome

Approach 1: Define a hashset and iterate through the string and insert into hashset if char not exists. If it exists increment the count by 2 because that
character occur even number of items and then remove it from the hashset. At the end check the length of hashset is greater than 0 then just add +1 to the count. 

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(1) constant---- > Max characters in the hash set is only alphabets (26)

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        hashset=set()
        count=0
        for i in s:
            if i not in hashset:
                hashset.add(i)
            else:
                count+=2
                hashset.remove(i)
                
        if len(hashset) >0:
            count+=1
        return count
        
  
 Approach2 :
 The Counter() function in collections module will be used which returns a dictionary with iterable as character and value as count.rble or the mapping.
 
 class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        dic = collections.Counter(s)
        Max_length=0
        for key,val in dic.items():
            Max_length+=(2 if val % 2 ==0 else 2)
        if Max_length!=len(s):
            Max_length+=1
        else:
            return Max_length
