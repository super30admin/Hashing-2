# APPROACH 3: OPTIMAL SOLUTION
# Time Complexity : O(n) - n is the length of nums
# Space Complexity : O(n) - size of hashmap
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. Store hashmap where key is the sum and value is the lowest index at which this sum was obtained
# 2. for each element of the list, compute the sum in this way -> for 0: add 1 and for 1: add -1
# 3. Check if the sum exist in hashmap (x - k, but k is 0 here), if so, update the max length found so far.
#                                                                 Else, store the sum in hashmap and the index. (don't update when we find the same sum again as we need to 
#                                                                       find the longest length here, so we need lowest index possible)
