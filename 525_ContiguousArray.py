NOTE - Running sum can be used for finding a target in a contiguous array


Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Idea - 
Running sum: Consider 1 as 1 and 0 as -1, maintain a running sum, if the running sum exists, the elements between them
make balanced contiguous substring (sum is 0). Compare against the max length and adjust.
Also maintain a dummy value to consider the first element as well (something to compare to)
