409. Longest Palindrome


Time Complexity : O(N)
 

Space Complexity : O(1)


Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes


Here hashSet is usd to store the aplphabets.
If there is a repeating character in the set its removed from the set and count is increated by 2

At the end, if there are any elements present in the set, then count+1 is returnend else the couunt
