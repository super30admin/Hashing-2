#To find number of subarrays that sum to k, keep a running sum from the first element to each of the next element in the list of numbers.
# Each time a (running sum - k) appears in the in the list of running sums already found, it means that subarray from the previous point to now sums to k and we increment our count by how many times that runnning sum was found.
