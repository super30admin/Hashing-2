# we first declare one enmpty list and an count variable. we iterate through the string s and see if it is present in the list l, if it is present in the list l we 
# increment count by 2 and remove it from the string. else we add it to the string. we return the count if the length of list is 0 or we add 1 and return the count
# if the lenght of the list is >0.
