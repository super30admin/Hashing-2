                Iterate over the string, add each char to a set.
                If the set already has that char then it means we have
                found a pair. Remove it since it can make a palindrome.
                Keep doing until we are done with a string.
                A palindrome string can have only one odd string which does
                not have a pair. If the set is not empty it means we have
                char which donot have a pair. We add one to the result.
